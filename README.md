## SharePlace - Geolocation and Mapping Application

**Description:**  
This project is a simple JavaScript application that helps users find and share their geographical location. The application allows users to either locate their current position using the browser's geolocation feature or find a location by entering an address. The location is then displayed on an interactive map, and a shareable link is generated for easy sharing.
