**Description:**  
There are many projects on this repository and you can clone it using git clone or download the entire repository in GitHub also for some projects I would have deleted the Node modules - so download the Node modules if necessary.
For separate projects, I would have added a separate ReadMe file for that specific project so refer to that for any queries.
